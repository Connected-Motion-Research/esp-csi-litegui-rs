# esp-csi-litegui-rs

`esp-csi-litegui-rs` is a Rust no-std bare metal lightweight graphical user interface (GUI) application that runs on top of the [`esp-csi-rs`](https://github.com/Connected-Motion-Research/esp-csi-rs) crate.  `esp-csi-litegui-rs` provides an emebedded display graphical interface to visualize Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) collected from ESP devices.

This application takes advantage of the [`embedded-graphics`](https://github.com/embedded-graphics-rs/embedded-graphics) crate to draw the CSI data.

## Supported Boards
This application currently supports the following displays:
- [Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED 1.8](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-touch-amoled-1.8.htm)

## Minimum Requirements
### üõ†Ô∏è Hardware
You would need one of the supported development boards listed above.

### üìÄ Software
At a minimum, you would need the following:
* Rust toolchain with ESP target support installed. Full instructions for setting up a development environment are available [here](https://docs.esp-rs.org/book/installation/index.html). 
* Tool for flashing the firmware. It is recommended to use `esp-flash`. Installation instructions are available [here](https://docs.esp-rs.org/book/tooling/espflash.html).
* (Optional) A terminal program to view the output. It is also recommended to use `esp-flash` which was installed in the previous step.

> ‚ÄºÔ∏è Installing `espflash` requires a Rust installation. If you don't have Rust installed, follow the instructions on the [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) website.


## üìã Usage
There are a few ways in which we can obtain CSI data. One is either through a connection between a Station and an Access point, or alternatively sniffing network packets. For better looking heatmaps, its recommended to establish a connection.

To operate in sniffer mode, you'd need to change the configuration of the `CSICollector` abstraction in `main.rs`. For more detail, you are recommended to refer to the  [`esp-csi-rs`](https://github.com/Connected-Motion-Research/esp-csi-rs) crate documentation.

1. ***Setup Project***: Clone this repository.
2. ***Modify*** **`main.rs`**: Head to the `main.rs` file modify the `"SSID"` and `"PASSWORD"` strings in the following code to match your access point:

```rust
WiFiConfig {
    ssid: "SSID".try_into().unwrap(),
    password: "PASSWORD".try_into().unwrap(),
    ..Default::default()
},
```

3. ***Build & Run***: execute the following command in the terminal to build then run the project:
```bash
cargo run --release
```
